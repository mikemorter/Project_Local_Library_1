# Project_Local_Library_1

Qualified assignment and project rubric
Project description: Local library
Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

Other people are taking care of the logistics and design, but they need you to build the algorithms!

Creating an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings
Writing strings that embed expressions using template literals
Accessing all the values and keys of an object
Using find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems
Using reduce() to solve different problems
Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways
